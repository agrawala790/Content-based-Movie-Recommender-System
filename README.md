3. Coding in Java using J2EE, JDBC, JSP, MySQL, Tomcat, Netbeans, XAMPP Server. 
4. Testing and validating the outcomes.

Tasks I have performed :-
1. Analysed users views and listed the functional requirements. 
2. Created the profile of users based on the their ratings and genres of movies.  
3. Computed the similarity between user profile and movie profile using Cosine Similarity Algorithm. 
4. Computed average rating of the movies in the movie database.
5. Based on both similarity and average rating I found that how much a user is interested in a particular movie. 
6. Finally, I recommended the most relevant movies to the users according to their interests.
